    "original_text": "The System allows a web ready computer, cell phone or PDA to control a home's temperature, humidity, lights, security, and the state of small appliances. Users monitor and control home devices and systems. The system equipes with various environmental controllers and sensors. The sensor reads and saved value in the home database. The user read the temperature at a thermostat position. The user set the thermostat temperatures to between 60 ° F and 80 ° F, inclusive, at one degree increments. If a thermostat device allows a user to make a manual temperature setting, the setting remains in effect until the end of the planned or default time period, at which time the planned or default setting will be used for the next time period. The system compatibles with a centralized HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning). The system adheres to the standards, policies and procedures of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers [ASHRAE 2010]. The user monitor and control a home’s humidity from any location, using a web ready computer, cell phone, or PDA. The user read the humidity at a humidistat position. The user sets the humidity level for a humidistat, from 30% to 60%, inclusive a 1% increments. The system uses wireless signals to communicate, through the master control unit, with the humidistats. The system consists of contact sensors and a set security alarms. The system manages up to fifty door and window contact sensors. The system activates both light and sound alarms one sound alarm and one light alarm subsystem, with multiple lights. The system provides information about the state of a power switch (OFF or ON), indicating the whether an appliance connected to the power switch is OFF or ON. The system changes the state of a power switch (OFF to ON, or ON to OFF), in turn changing the state of an appliance connected to the power switch. If a user changes the state of power switch device manually, the device remains in that state until the end of the planned or default time period, at which time the planned or default setting will be used for the next time period. The system set various preset home parameters (temperature, humidity, security contacts, and on/off appliance/light status) for certain time periods. System provides a monthly planner. The user overrides planned parameter values, through the DH website, or if available, through manual switches on household devices. The system provides a report on the management and control of the home.\n\n",
